ReactOS BuildBot Build Scripts
==============================

Some possible usage scenarios for these scripts:

* Plainbot: Builds a Boot-CD, Live-CD, Test-CD, triggers a Testbot for testing it and uploads the created ISO file.
  If a patch ID is given, the patch is applied first, but the build is not uploaded.
* Testbot:  Triggered by a Plainbot, performs regression testing on a Test-CD and submits the results.
  Generally, this one is implemented as an independent builder to not block the Plainbot doing its other tasks. But its steps can also be integrated inside a Plainbot.


Add the following steps in this order to the Buildmaster's master.cfg depending on what type of Buildslave you want to set up.
If your Buildslave is more specific, you may as well leave out some steps.

Configuration files
-------------------
* buildbot.tac - Buildslave configuration file for BuildBot
* config.inc - Script settings, shared for all builders of this buildslave
* builder_config.inc - File in the "builddir" of each builder containing per-builder overrides of the config.inc settings

Also copy the following files to the "builddir" of each builder and rename them
* sysreg.xml.template -> sysreg.xml - General Settings for sysreg2
* reactos.xml.template -> reactos.xml - Settings of the VM used by sysreg2 and libvirt


Testing these scripts
---------------------
You can easily test these scripts as follows:
  * Move to /srv/buildbot/buildername/build
  * Run "sudo -u buildbot ../../SCRIPTNAME"
