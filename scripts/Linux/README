ReactOS BuildBot Build Scripts for Linux
========================================

These scripts can be used for the following types of Buildslaves:

* Plainbot: Can build, in any combination, Boot-CDs, Live-CDs, Test-CDs, trigger Testbots for testing them and upload the created ISO files
* Testbot:  Triggered by a Plainbot, performs regression testing on a Test-CD and submits the results 
* Patchbot: Applies a patch, builds a Test-CD, performs regression-testing and submits the results


Add the following steps in this order to the Buildmaster's master.cfg depending on what type of Buildslave you want to set up:

Step                                   | Plainbot | Testbot | Patchbot |

Configuration files
-------------------
* buildbot.tac - Buildslave configuration file for BuildBot
* config.inc - Script settings, shared for all builders of this buildslave
* builder_config.inc - File in the "builddir" of each builder containing per-builder overrides of the config.inc settings

Also copy the following files to the "builddir" of each builder and rename them
* sysreg.xml.template -> sysreg.xml - General Settings for sysreg2
* reactos.xml.template -> reactos.xml - Settings of the VM used by sysreg2 and libvirt


Testing these scripts
---------------------
You can easily test these scripts as follows:
  * Move to /srv/buildbot/buildername/build
  * Run "sudo -u buildbot ../../SCRIPTNAME"
