ReactOS BuildBot Build Scripts for Linux
========================================

These scripts can be used for the following types of Buildslaves:

* Plainbot: Can build, in any combination, Boot-CDs, Live-CDs, Test-CDs, trigger Testbots for testing them and upload the created ISO files
* Testbot:  Triggered by a Plainbot, performs regression testing on a Test-CD and submits the results 
* Patchbot: Applies a patch, builds a Test-CD, performs regression-testing and submits the results


Add the following steps in this order to the Buildmaster's master.cfg depending on what type of Buildslave you want to set up:

Step                                   | Plainbot | Testbot | Patchbot |
